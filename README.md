# Sample Portfolio website with `React` & `Sanity.io` 🐚

In this project I am trying to build a website using `React`, `Sanity.io` and `Tailwind CSS`. My main goal is to learn `Sanity.io` and explore more the **Headless CMS** concept, as well as practice more the rest of the technologies.

## `Sanity` installation 💡

- `npm install -g @sanity/cli`
- `sanity login`
- default dataset configuration
- confirming project output path
- project template -> blog
